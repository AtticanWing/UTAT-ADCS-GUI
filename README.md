# UTAT-ADCS-GUI
Personal repository of GUI project in the Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) subteam for the FINCH mission of University of Toronto Aerospace Design Tean (UTAT).
This GUI is to control the Helmholtz cage we are building that can create an artificial 3-axis uniform magnetic field to serve as a testbed for the FINCH CubeSat.
The FINCH CubeSat mission is designed for crop residue mapping in Low-Earth Orbit, aimed to launch in Q4 2024 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
